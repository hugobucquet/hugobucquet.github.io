## Experience

### Real World Evidence Data Analyst Intern  
**Sanofi**  
*Cambridge, Massachusetts*  
May -- August 2024  
- Developed a predictive modeling algorithm that efficiently selects relevant features while nearly maximizing accuracy in predicting outcomes for a population of ITP patients  
- Collaborated with analysts and epidemiologists to define and create patient cohorts based on complex criteria for multiple studies, leveraging a dataset comprising over 80 million patients  
- Using Python and SQL, created a pipeline that automates analyses by taking cohort parameters as input and producing both a SQL table with the cohort data and an Excel file with relevant statistics  

### Visiting Research Student  
**ACDC Photovoltaic Research Group - UNSW**  
*Sydney, Australia*  
March -- July 2023  
- Implemented a pipeline to automate the process of generating extensive datasets of luminescence images

## Projects

### Research on RSA and Factoring  
**Columbia University**  
April 2024 - May 2024  
- Worked with Professors Malkin and Mitropolsky to explore different reductions from the RSA problem to the factoring problem, examining the relationship between the two under various assumptions and models of computation  
- Defined a relaxed version of the RSA problem to try to fit it in the TFNP hierarchy  

### Research on Medical Image Registration  
**Ecole Polytechnique**  
September 2022 - January 2023  
- Worked with Professor Allassonni√®re to study and implement two image registration algorithms: one constructing a diffeomorphic mapping between images, and another based on deep learning methods  
- Analyzed the algorithms' performances and compared their efficiency based on input images
